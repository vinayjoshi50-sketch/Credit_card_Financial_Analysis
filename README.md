Welcome to the Credit card Financial Analysis Project repository! ðŸš€

This project demonstrates a comprehensive weekly analysis of credit card transaction for the period 2023.From importing data from csv files to cleaning and transforming them in SSMS to building interactive dashboards in Power BI to generate actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data Processing and Analytics.


Project Overview ðŸŽ¯
---

This Project Involves:
  1)	Data Sources: Import data from two source systems into the SQL Server database.
  2)	Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis
  3)	Integration: get tables into the Power BI via import query.
  4)	Measures: create additional measures to support data model and insight generation.
  5)	Report: Build a dashboard to support strategic decision making.

Project Requirements ðŸš€

 1. Data Sources
    * Import datasets from two primary systems:
    * Transactions.csv (financial and operational records)
    * Customer_details.csv (customer demographics and attributes)
    *	Load both sources into a SQL Server database for centralized storage and management.
 2.	Data Quality & Preparation:   
    * Perform data cleansing to address missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
    * Standardize formats (e.g., dates, IDs) to ensure consistency across datasets.
 3.	Data Integration
    *	Import the curated tables into Power BI using optimized import queries.
    *	Apply transformations in Power Query where necessary for performance and consistency.
 4.	Measures & Data Modeling
    *	Define calculated columns and DAX measures (e.g., week on week revenue).
    *	Validate measures against business rules to ensure accuracy.
 5.	Reporting & Dashboarding
    * Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard with clear KPIs, trend analysis, and segmentation views.
    * Incorporate professional design principles (colour palette, layout, accessibility).
    *	Enable drill-throughs and filters for deeper analysis by stakeholders.
    *	Deliver insights that support strategic decisions in customer management, revenue optimization, and operational efficiency.

Insights - ðŸ“ˆ
---
  1. Higher value spending:  
     * Q3 recorded the highest revenue alongside the highest transaction volume, whereas Q4 generated slightly lower revenue despite having the lowest number of transactions. This contrast suggests that Q4 performance was driven by large-ticket purchases. 
     * Spending behavior in Q4 can may be attributed to festival spendings.
  2. Transaction Volume vs. Revenue:
     * 656K transactions generated 45M in transaction value.
     * Average transaction size â‰ˆ $68.6.
  3. Interest Income: 
     * Total interest is 7.8M, which is a significant revenue driver (~65% of total revenue).
     * Suggests reliance on revolving balances.
  4. Revenue by Card Type:
     *	Blue cards dominate (5M), followed by Platinum (4M) and Gold (3M).
     *	Indicates mass-market cards are driving volume, while premium cards still contribute significantly.
  5. Transaction Mode:
     *	Swipe transactions dominate (0.52M), while Chip (0.03M) and Online (0.01M) are very low.
     *	Suggests digital adoption is weak.
  6. Weekly Growth:
     *	Revenue grows steadily week-on-week (~0.45â€“0.5%).
     *	Growth is consistent but incremental, not exponential.
